# Dimensionality-Reduction

This repository consists of the scripts I've performed on Dimensionality Reduction.   

1. Principal Component Analysis: This project uses Principal Component Analysis to predict which wine belongs to which customer category. This can 
                                  help in selling the right wine to the right customer. This dataset consists of different features related to the 
                                  quality of wine, where each row represents a particular wine and each column represents a feature of the wine. The 
                                  files in this project are:    
                                  - principal_component_analysis.ipynb: python script.    
                                  - Wine.csv: dataset.
